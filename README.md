# WHAT DOES THIS DO?
This is a container that runs the TLA+ Toolbox.

# WHY?
* TLA+ Toolbox requires Java.
	* Who wants to install Java?
* TLA+ is neat... you should keep reading!
* Impress your friends by running a GUI application in Docker.

# WHAT IS TLA+?
_"TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems."_ ([source](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla-intro.html))

# HOW DO I LEARN MORE?
Visit [The TLA Home Page](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html).

# HOW DO I RUN IT?
0. Make sure I'm on a system running [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).
1. Disable X access control (don't do this on a public-facing machine): `$ xhost +`
2. `$ cd` to a path where you want to write some .tla files.
3. ``$ docker run -d -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v `pwd`:`pwd` -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY hackenfreude/tlatoolbox-1.5.2``
4. You should see the TLA+ splash screen and eventually the TLA Toolbox.
5. Use the TLA Toolbox menu: File/Open Spec/Add New Spec.
6. Enter /container/host/path/you/were/in/when/starting/this/container/{foo}.tla as the root-module name. The specification name should auto-complete to {foo}. Click Finish.
7. Have fun. Write some specifications. Close the TLA+ Toolbox when you're done, and the container will shut down. Your files will be in the path on the host where you started.
8. Reenable X acccess control: `$ xhost -`

# WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
* Docker mounted the host's X socket in the continer as the container's X socket; this allows the container's GUI to pass back up to the host.
* Docker mounted the host's working directory in the container at the same path.

# WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK ON MY MACHINE?
Open an [issue](https://github.com/hackenfreude/docker-tlatoolbox-1.5.2/issues/new).
